  - Batch size optimization (configurable, default 10)
  - Memory usage optimization for large operations
  - Progressive processing with individual error handling
  - Maximum item limits to prevent resource exhaustion

## âœ… Enhanced User Interface and Management

### 1. Security & Performance Settings Tab

- **Implementation**:
  - Dedicated settings tab for security and performance options
  - Rate limit configuration interface
  - Cache expiration settings
  - Security logging controls
  - Management actions (clear cache, cleanup logs)
  - Real-time status indicators

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Widget
- **Location**: `includes/ai/class-fmr-ai-dashboard-widget.php` (enhanced)
- **Implementation**:
  - Security status monitoring with color-coded indicators
  - Performance metrics display (avg execution time, memory usage)
  - Cache statistics (entries, size, status)
  - Recent security events tracking
  - Quick action buttons for cache management
  - Real-time data loading via AJAX

### 3. Maintenance Scheduler
- **Location**: `includes/ai/class-fmr-maintenance-scheduler.php`
- **Implementation**:
  - Daily maintenance: cache cleanup, security log cleanup, performance metrics cleanup
